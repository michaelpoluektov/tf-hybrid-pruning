# sparse-riscv
TB2 individual project -- Sparsifying CNN's and optimising for RISC-V

## Motivation
This project aims to create a wrapper that, given a pre-trained deep CNN will optimise it for inference on RISC-V processors. We assume that we only have access to the test/validation data.
As of now no part of this project is specific to RISC-V, but since RISC-V is commonly used for low-power devices this is what we will later use to implement TFLite operators and benchmark our model.

## Approach
There are 3 steps to this project:
1. Reducing the complexity of our model
2. Implementing TFLite operators that can take advantage of that reduced complexity
3. Tweaking step 1 to fit step 2 better and vice-versa

### Reducing complexity
So far the following ways of reducing model complexity are being considered:
- Weight pruning based on magnitude
- Activation pruning based on magnitude
- Re-structuring the model under the assumptions that certain activations can be treated as constants
- Re-structuring the model under the assumptions that certain activations can be assumed to be identical

The first 2 points can be done using simple binary search on each layer, pruning based on the percentile of magnitudes.
The 3rd point can be done using binary search, pruning the activations with the lowest standard deviations. This may be sub-optimal if the standard deviation is not representative of the activation's importance (such as the edges of the image)
The 4th point can be done by finding highly correlated activations, but that may be too slow.

### Implementing TFLite operators
This will most likely involve implementing a sparse Conv2D layer with activation pruning. We assume the possibility to use P and V extensions.

### Tweaking
Can we co-design the pruning method and the operator?
